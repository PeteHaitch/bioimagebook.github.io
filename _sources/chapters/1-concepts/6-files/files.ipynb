    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the surest ways to lose information when working with images is by making bad file format choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vast array of file formats used to store images -- but not all formats support all the bit-depths, types and dimensions needed for scientific imaging.\n",
    "Some formats tend to lose metadata, and some compromise pixel values through compression.\n",

    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always keep your original image files, in their original format\n",
    "* During analysis:\n",
    "  * Use software designed for scientific data (i.e. not a general photo editor)\n",
    "  * If you need to save images, use the default file format for the software (e.g. TIFF for ImageJ)\n",
    "  * **Check everything!** Make sure you can reopen the image after saving, and any pixel values, pixel size information and dimensions are retained exactly.\n",
    "* Use general-purpose file formats (e.g. PNG, JPEG) for figures, presentations or websites -- but not later analysis\n",
    "* Use TIFF cautiously, because it can be used both as a scientific format suitable for analysis and a general-purpose format suitable only for display\n",
    "  * OME-TIFF is often a better alternative to TIFF, since it standardizes how the metadata is stored\n",

    "An image file stored on computer contains two main things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pixel values** -- the 'raw numbers' of the image\n",
    "2. **Metadata** -- additional information, such as dimensions, image type, bit-depth, pixel sizes and microscope settings ('data about data')\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel values are clearly important.\n",
    "But some pieces of the metadata are essential for the image data to be interpretable at all.\n",
    "And if metadata such as the pixel size is incorrect or missing, measurements can also be wrong.\n",
    "Therefore files must be saved in formats that preserve both the pixel values and metadata accurately if they are to be suitable for analysis later."

    "### Pixel values & compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixel values are represented using bytes.\n",
    "As described in {ref}`chap_bit_depths`, an 8-bit image uses 1 byte per pixel, a 16-bit image uses 2 bytes per pixel and a 32-bit image uses 4 bytes per pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the way these bytes are stored in the image file can depending upon whether compression is used.\n",
    "There are three main options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No compression**.\n",
    "The bytes representing the pixels are stored directly in the file.\n",
    "This means that the pixel values are preserved exactly, but the file can be quite large.\n",
    "  * *Examples: TIFF (Uncompressed), ICS/IDS*\n",
    "* **Lossless compression**.\n",
    "The bytes representing the pixels are stored using a compression algorithm that (usually) results in less storage space being required, while making it possible to reconstruct the original values exactly by decompression.\n",
    "Compared to uncompressed data, the file size using lossless compression is generally smaller but reading or writing the file takes longer.\n",
    "  * *Examples: TIFF (LZW compressed), PNG, BMP, JPEG2000 (lossless)*\n",
    "* **Lossy compression**.\n",
    "The bytes representing the pixels are stored using a compression algorithm that does *not* have to be able to reconstruct the original values exactly.\n",
    "This can result in dramatically smaller file sizes, but at a loss of information in the image -- and often visual artefacts.\n",
    "  * *Examples: TIFF (JPEG compressed), JPEG, GIF, JPEG2000 (lossy)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the most famous file format that uses lossy compression is JPEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of JPEG compression is that an image is split into 8x8 pixel blocks, and an approximation of the original values is stored rather than the exact values themselves.\n",
    "Technically, this approximation involves the 'discrete cosine transform'; for our purposes, it's enough to know that JPEG artefacts tend to look 8x8 pixel squares, each containing wavy patterns, which are most evident when zooming in and/or cranking up the brightness and contrast to an extreme level ({numref}`fig-files_lossy`)."

    "The most important piece of 'non-core' metadata is the {ref}`pixel size <chap_pixel_size>`.\n",
    "Unlike core metadata, it is *not* necessary for a file format to preserve the pixel size for an image to be opened and appear 'correct'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem because if the pixel size is incorrect or missing, it remains possible to make length, area or volume measurements within an image -- but these measurements are likely to be wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "In microscopy, the pixel size is typically represented as a value in µm/pixel.\n",
    "Saving in some file formats (e.g. JPEG and PNG) tends to lose pixel size information.\n",
    "Others (e.g. TIFF) *might* preserve the pixel size, *might* lose it, or *might* convert it to something else entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should sound odd, scary and outrageous.\n",
    "Losing pixel size information is one thing, but why would any sneaky software just change the value to something else??!?\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this, we need to remember that most images aren't intended for analysis.\n",
    "Most are intended only for display.\n",
    "And, for display, size can have a different meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many researchers already encounter this when it comes to publishing papers.\n",
    "Journals often require that figures are submitted at a sufficiently high resolution for printing, with the resolution defined in terms of **dots per inch (*dpi*)**.\n",
    "For example, an image might be requested that is at least 300 dpi; if it should be printed at a size of 2 x 2 inches, then it should be at least 600 x 600 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an image with a dpi of 300, one *could* argue that a single pixel has a size of 1/300 inches.\n",
    "In this case, size is related to display.\n",
    "It doesn't matter what the image depicts -- it could be a cell, a person, a building, a galaxy -- or tell us anything about its scale.\n",
    "In this case, the pixel size is only telling us how the image ought to be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to TIFF images, the pixel size for science or the pixel size for display (i.e. dpi) might be stored *in exactly the same part of the file*.\n",
    "Therefore what this value actually means depends entirely upon which software wrote the image, and whether it was more concerned with analysis or display.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "**Always sanity-check pixel size values!**\n",

    "\n",
    "### During acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{margin}\n",

    ":class: tip\n",
    "Use the default file format for your microscope and acquisition software\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale is that the manufacturer's format ought to preserve all the information and metadata.\n",
    "Often, the acquisition software supports saving the data in some other way -- but that can be risky.\n",
    "There's a strong chance that at least some metadata could be lost.\n",
    "Sometimes, the alternative export might do even worse things -- such as convert the data to RGB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage of this is that microscopy formats are usually uncommon in the rest of the world, which means your images might be hard to open in other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fortunately, there is a magnificent open-source project to help with this: [**Bio-Formats**](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/).**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bio-Formats enables a [wide range of different formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html) to be read by many different software applications.\n",
    "It's already available within Fiji and QuPath by default, or can be installed as a plugin for ImageJ.\n",
    "Although it's written in Java, Bio-Formats can also be used within some Python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If* you are unlucky enough that the native format for your microscope isn't supported by Bio-Formats, you might need to export it in a different format for use elsewhere.\n",
    "But if you do this, it's best to retain a copy of the original data anyway -- so you can always refer to it using the original acquisition software to check what (if anything) might have been lost in the export.\n",
    "\n",

    "### During analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to save an image during analysis, the rule is\n",
    ":::{admonition} Saving images during analysis\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "Use the default file format for the analysis software you're using -- or OME-TIFF\n",
    ":::\n",
    "Like the rule for acquisition, the idea is that this will generally preserve as much metadata as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ImageJ, the default format is an uncompressed TIFF image.\n",
    "This supports 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images with up to 5 dimensions, squeezing the key metadata required by ImageJ (e.g. pixel size) into one of the TIFF fields.\n",
    "All of this information should then be available if you open the image again in ImageJ or Fiji -- although it is not *necessarily* preserved if you open the TIFF in other software, which may not know how to interpret ImageJ's metadata.\n",
    "So if this is important to you, you'll need to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "*However*, this might not be the best choice if you want to continue working with your image in different software.\n",
    "In that case, it might take some exploration to see which formats enable metadata to be saved in a way that your preferred software applications recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using software that incorporates Bio-Formats, the best option is likely to be OME-TIFF.\n",
    "Bio-Formats can read and write OME-TIFF images, which has a very well-defined standard for storing metadata (developed by the group behind Bio-Formats itself).\n",
    "This opens up more possibilities, such as writing TIFFs that include either lossless or lossy compression.\n",
    "OME-TIFF can also contain a lot more metadata than an ImageJ TIFF can, including things like stage position, laser power etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### For display\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to displaying images, we usually only need a format that can support RGB images.\n",
    "Since we won't use the image for further analysis, we don't need to preserve the pixel size and don't *necessarily* have to avoid compression artefacts.\n",
    "My personal preferred formats for different scenarios are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Journal figure: TIFF.** <br /> Often the journal requests this anyway. Even if I'm not convinced it always makes sense.\n",
    "* **Presentation: PNG.** <br /> File size is not usually a problem, and PNG provides some compression without introducing artefacts.\n",
    "* **Website: JPEG or PNG**, <br />JPEG (usually) because smaller file sizes mean the website can load quicker (and eat less data).\n",
    "But PNG for images that contain few colors, including most 'artificial' images such as drawings, dialog boxes or logos.\n",
    "JPEG artifacts can look especially ugly in such cases, while PNG can compress them very well."
